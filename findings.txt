- no correct results, therefore only the sizes of the results are considered
- sometimes words at the beginning of the training
- different test result sizes
- strong fluctuations in the model results during training
- the result improves with more training, up to epoch 62 with a learning rate of 2e-05
- Phases with bad results over a period of epochs
- lower learning rate is better
- bigger model better results?
